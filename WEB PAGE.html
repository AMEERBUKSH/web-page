    <p ><strong>ISLAMABAD:</strong> A day after the federal cabinet approved an ordinance pertaining to the sale of national assets in a bid to overcome the economic crisis faced by the country, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan opposed the legislation and said the “thieves” should not be allowed to sell the assets.

    On his Twitter account, the former prime minister said: “How can imported government brought to power through US conspiracy, led by ‘crime minister’, whose family along with Zardari have volumes written on their corruption, be trusted with the sale of national assets and that too through bypassing all procedural and legal checks.”
    
    “These people have been plundering Pakistan for the last 30 years and are now responsible for the present economic meltdown. These thieves should never be allowed to sell our national assets in the devious manner they are attempting. The nation will never trust them with our national assets,” the PTI chief further said.The remarks by the former premier came a day after the federal cabinet gave its nod to a law proposed by the Cabinet Committee on the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions to sell stakes of oil and gas companies and government-owned power plants to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries.

    As per the ordinance, courts will not be able to entertain petitions against the sale of assets and shares of state-owned companies to foreign countries.
    
    A source in the government said that the proposed law will be tabled in parliament for approval as it rejected the claim made by Mr Khan that the proposed law will allow the government to sell any asset of the country without following the laid down procedure. The source said, “No asset will be sold without the approval of the cabinet.”
    
    Defending the proposed legislation, the source said except for one deal, not a single agreement inked by Pakistan with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar materialised during the past five years as foreign states were not ready to invest through the Privatisation Commission.
    
    Under the proposed law, foreign states will be able to invest directly in state-owned entities. “This would improve management of these entities, as the said states would bring efficient management to run these enterprises,” the source added.
    
    Ordinance for sale of assets
    
    The proposed law will provide for a mechanism to carry out a commercial transaction under an inter-governmental framework agreement to promote, attract and encourage foreign states to have economic and business relations with Pakistan, according to the documents.
    
    The scope of the law will be expanded to all “commercial transactions” including sale, purchase, investment, divestment, procurement, licensing, lease, joint ventures, assignments, concessions, services contracts, management contracts or other deals arising out of a G2G (government-to-government) or commercial agreement, the documents added.

    <h1>Hamza or Pervaiz: Punjab Assembly to finalize CM today !</h1>
    LAHORE (Dunya News) – The political atmosphere has become extremely intense in Punjab prior to the election of Punjab Chief Minister, which is to be held today (Friday).

The two candidates for the Punjab Chief Ministership namely Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Hamza Shahbaz and Speaker Punjab Assembly Pervaiz Elahi will be competing for the seat once again.

In this regard, a meeting of the parliamentary party of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was held at Bilawal House. The PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari directed all members to ensure attendance in the assembly.

On the other hand, a joint meeting of the parliamentary party of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) was also held under the chairmanship of PTI Chairperson Imran Khan, in which 186 members were completed. While, the Deputy Speaker of Punjab Assembly Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari did not attend the meeting.

Meanwhile, both sides have been claiming superiority over each other.

According to PTI leader Fawad Chaudhary 186 members were present in the meeting.

The former Federal Minister Moonis Elahi was highly confident for Pervaiz Elahi’s victory. He said it’s over for the government. Our numbers are more than required.

LHC stops police to enter Punjab Assembly

The Lahore High Court on Friday stopped the police from entering the assembly prior to the election for Punjab Chief Minister.

The court while taking action on the petition filed by Speaker Punjab Assembly Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, directed that the police will be able to enter the assembly only if the law and order situation deteriorates.

Earlier today, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi filed a petition in the Supreme Court (SC) against the police security in the hall of the provincial assembly.

The Speaker Punjab Assembly requested in the petition to order the IG Punjab that no policeman should enter the assembly hall and the sergeants should be allowed to secure the area.

He stated after losing the majority in the Punjab Assembly, Hamza Shahbaz is not ready to accept defeat and therefore efforts are being made by PML-N to disrupt the elections by taking unconstitutional measures.

The Supreme Court has ordered clean and transparent elections on July 1, he added.

He further mentioned an illegal notice has been issued for the appointment of police in place of sergeants in the assembly hall.

Hamza Shahbaz, Deputy Speaker, Chief Secretary and IG Punjab have been made parties in the petition.

People will come out if attempt made to steal mandate, warns Asad Umar

Talking to the media, former Federal Minister Asad Umar said that their numbers are complete for the election of Punjab Chief Minister and there will be no surprise today.

“We have complete numbers and if an attempt is made to steal the mandate, people will come out on their own,” he said.

Asad Umar added that Asif Zardari being in action is a good thing as it represents the panic on their side.

Further criticizing the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-chairman he said they used to talk about the magnified influence of Zardari’s politics, but now that politics is over. Politics inside the closed rooms will not work in Pakistan anymore, he added.

He said that, “Our members in the Punjab Assembly have no reservations and our unanimous candidate is Pervaiz Elahi.”

Fawad Ch asks PML-N to accept defeat

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Fawad Chaudhry on Friday asked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz to accept defeat and leave the Punjab government.

Taking to Twitter, former federal minister Fawad wrote that the country cannot bear political instability and everyone should realize their responsibility in this context.

Fawad advised political parties to hold dialogue on the framework of the next general elections.

Session of the Punjab Assembly (PA) for the election of the provincial chief minister (CM) will be held today (Friday) at 4pm under the chairmanship of Deputy Speaker Dost Khan Mazari.

Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) leader Pervaiz Elahi is the candidate for the CM chair from PTI and alliance, while CM Hamza Shahbaz is Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and its ally parties’ candidate.
